My professional website ~~as dissertation doula~~, "Copyediting with care"

* On Friday 16 February 2024, I first gave it a go using the [Astral](https://html5up.net/astral) template by HTML5 UP. I got feedback from Jorge Fragua Valdivieso and Alex Wingate. The latter told me she likes the vibe of [Thrive PhD](https://www.thrive-phd.com/).
* On Sunday 18 February 2024, Leon van Wissen helped me set up this static page on GitHub.
* On Monday 19 February 2024, I switched over to the [Paradigm Shift](https://html5up.net/astral) template by HTML5 UP.
* On Friday 4 April 2025, I changed the tagline from "Dissertation doula" to "Copyediting with care" and updated the website, including the Font Awesome package.

* different translations of the same source text.

### Currently on different _work_ pages

* Different plagiarisms of the same Dickens source text.
